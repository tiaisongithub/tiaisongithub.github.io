           <th><p> Hey my name is Tia Dzafic and I am a 10th grader at Palm Desert High School. I plan to become a statistician when I am older, and to do so, I need to obtain at least a bachelor's degree in mathematics. Secondly, I need to complete a master's degree program. Next, I will need to earn a Ph. D in statistics. Then, I need to research employment options and career information. Finally, I will need to gain work experienceI am considering to get a second degree in computor science, so if I want to, I can become a software engineer.

<p2> Throughout my education I have signed up for multiple honors and AP classes. Last year, I have taken AP human geography which was the only available AP class for only 60 out of 500 freshman at my time, and have passed that class with a B. I am open to trying new things and challenging myself. Because of my various classes, I have learned to work with all kinds of people and learned to be flexible with their different personalities.

<br>
<p3> Given my knowledge of taking multiple honors classes, I have learned how to properly manage my time. I have taken Math II Honors during my freshman year and I am currently taking Math III Honors.
